DG portfolio

This website contains my personal portfolio as a sample of my initial works as front-end developer.

It is done using Jekyll server and code was customised for myself using Html5, CSS3, Sass by overwriting on
files from a free theme distributed for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)
from the website html5up.net

Images are of my property and you can find more samples of my work at digitalchief.ie or my behance space.

If any question or advice please contact me on my email or github page.

Regards.
